# React Test App

# Run the Apps

For this purpose we must run both apps in different terminals, the backend can be run in dev or normaly, but the front only can be displayed on dev mode, or build it and preview it with the preview command

## Backend 
```bash
/backend: $ pnpm start
```
> This run the server on [localhost:3001](http://localhost:5173/
)

## Frontend 

```bash
/frontend: $ pnpm dev
```
> This run the app on [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/)

or

```bash
/frontend: $ pnpm build & pnpm preview
```
> This build and run the app on [localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173/)
